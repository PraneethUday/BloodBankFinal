                Five Reasons to Donate Blood
            </h1>
            <div>
                <h2 class="list">
                    1. Development of new red blood cells
                </h2>
                <p class="p">
                    Within the first 48 hours of blood donation, the donor's body starts replenishing the lost red blood cells. The replenishment process helps in staying healthy and productive at work.Blood donation is safe for healthy adults. There’s no risk of contracting disease. New, sterile equipment is used for each donor.

                    Some people may feel nauseous, lightheaded, or dizzy after donating blood. If this happens, it should only last a few minutes. You can lie down with your feet up at the until you feel better.
                    
                    You may also experience some bleeding at the site of the needle. Applying pressure and raising your arm for a couple of minutes will usually stop this. You may develop a bruise at the site.
                </p>
                <h2 class="list">
                    2. Reducing risk of heart disease
                </h2>
                <p class="p">
                    As per several studies and reports, when there is a rise in the iron level in blood, it raises the chances of heart diseases. People should donate blood from time to time in order to reduce the iron level in the blood.You must register to donate blood. This includes providing identification, your medical history, and undergoing a quick physical examination. You’ll also be given some information about blood donation to read.

                    Once you’re ready, your blood donation procedure will begin. Whole blood donation is the most common type of donation. This is because it offers the most flexibility. It can be transfused as whole blood or separated into red cells, platelets, and plasma for different recipients.
                </p>
                <h2 class="list">
                    3. Burns calories
                </h2>
                <p class="p">
                    Donating blood can burn approximately 650 calories for each pint that is like 450 ml of blood.These types of donations are performed using a process called apheresis. An apheresis machine is connected to both of your arms. It collects a small amount of blood and separates the components before returning the unused components back to you. This cycle is repeated several times over approximately two hours.

                    Once your donation is complete, you’ll be given a snack and a drink and be able to sit and rest for 10 or 15 minutes before you leave. If you feel faint or nauseous, you’ll be able to lie down until you feel better.
                </p>
                <h2 class="list">
                    4. Free blood test
                </h2>
                <p class="p">
                    On donating blood, the donor receives a free mini health screening and blood tests.You need to be 17 or older to donate whole blood. Some states allow you to donate at 16 with parental consent.
                    You have to weigh at least 110 pounds and be in good health to donate.
                    You need to provide information about medical conditions and any medications you’re taking. These may affect your eligibility to donate blood.
                    You must wait at least 8 weeks between whole blood donations and 16 weeks between double red cell donations.
                </p>
                <h2 class="list">
                    5. How often can one donate blood?
                </h2>
                <p class="p">
                    The minimum time advised between two donations is 3 months. This gap helps blood regain the normal haemoglobin count.The research is mixed on whether blood donation actually lowers risk of heart disease and heart attack.

                    A 2017 studyTrusted Source suggests that regular blood donations are associated with increased risk of heart disease possibly due to unfavorable cholesterol levels
                    
                    However, donating blood regularly may lower iron stores, according to a 2013 studyTrusted Source. This may reduce the risk of heart attack. High body iron stores are believed to increase the risk of heart attack.
                    
                    Regular blood donations were thought to lower blood pressureTrusted Source, but a 2017 studyTrusted Source suggests these observations are deceiving and are not a real physiological response.

                <h3 class="list">
                    Who can donate blood
                </h3>
                <p class="p">
                    The age of the donor must be above 18 years and below 65 years of age. He/she must have a haemoglobin count that is not less than 12.5 g/dl. The Weigh should not less than 45 kgs. One should have a normal body temperature at the time of donation.
                <br>
                <br>
                You should always drink lots of water before the donation. Also, keep in mind that you should take a well-balanced meal prior to and after donating blood. This will keep you healthy and fit.
                <br>
                <br>
                Transfusion of blood is an essential part of modern health care management. The first Blood Centre was started in India by Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) in 1942 at All India Institute of Hygiene & Public Health, Calcutta (West Bengal).
                In 1977, the Blood Centre started operating from the Indian Red Cross Society, National Headquarters (IRCS, NHQ). The Blood Centre is running round the clock and provides the services to the needy patients. It was designated as Regional Blood Centre by State Govt. in 1996 and has been designated as Model Blood Centre in 2010 by National AIDS Control Organization, Ministry of Health and Family Welfare, Govt of India and is also certified by the BIS for ISO 9001:2008 and accredited by NABH & NABL.
