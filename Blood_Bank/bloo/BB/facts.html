                        Transfusion of blood is an essential part of modern health care management. The first Blood
                        Centre
                        was started in India by Indian Red Cross Society (IRCS) in 1942 at All India Institute of
                        Hygiene &
                        Public Health, Calcutta (West Bengal).
                        In 1977, the Blood Centre started operating from the Indian Red Cross Society, National
                        Headquarters
                        (IRCS, NHQ). The Blood Centre is running round the clock and provides the services to the needy
                        patients. It was designated as Regional Blood Centre by State Govt. in 1996 and has been
                        designated
                        as Model Blood Centre in 2010 by National AIDS Control Organization, Ministry of Health and

                        The NHQ Blood Centre focuses on encouraging voluntary blood donation. It collects approximately
                        30000 units of blood annually . The percentage of voluntary blood collection is 100% in IRCS and
                        there is 100% component separation of blood units collected. The Blood Centre provides 90% of

            <h1 class="intro">WHAT CAN YOU DO FOR IRON DEFICIENCY</h1>
            <div style="background-color: crimson; margin: 18px;border-radius: 10px;border: 4px solid black;text-align: justify;">
                <p style="padding: 20px;">
                Low iron levels can be a temporary, easily-remedied condition. Someone who is iron deficient will absorb
                more iron than someone whose iron level is normal. Iron is best absorbed from meat and seafood. If you
                have severe or consistently low iron counts, you should consult with your personal physician.
                Every day, normal bone marrow cycles one trillion red blood cells through your blood stream. Hemoglobin,
                a protein in red blood cells, cannot be produced in the bone marrow unless the body has a good supply of
                iron.</p>
            <h2 class="list">Heme Iron Sources</h2>
            <p class="p">Red Meat: Beef, lamb, and pork are excellent sources of heme iron.
                Poultry: Chicken and turkey, especially dark meat, contain significant amounts of heme iron.
                Seafood: Shellfish such as clams, oysters, and mussels, as well as fish like sardines and mackerel, are high in heme iron.
                Liver and Organ Meats: Liver (beef or chicken) is particularly rich in iron.</p>
                <h2 class="list">
                    Non-Heme sources
                </h2>
                <p class="p">Legumes: Lentils, chickpeas, beans (black, kidney, navy), and soybeans are great plant-based sources of iron.
                    Tofu and Tempeh: Both are soy-based products that are high in iron.
                    Nuts and Seeds: Pumpkin seeds, sesame seeds, hemp seeds, and cashews are rich in iron.
                    Leafy Greens: Spinach, kale, and Swiss chard contain non-heme iron, though the absorption can be hindered by oxalates present in these greens.
                    Whole Grains: Quinoa, brown rice, and fortified cereals are good sources.
                    Dried Fruits: Apricots, raisins, and prunes can help increase iron intake.</p>
                <h2 class="list">Tips to Enhance Iron Absorption:</h2>
                <p class="p">Pair with Vitamin C: Consuming vitamin C-rich foods (such as citrus fruits, strawberries, bell peppers, and broccoli) alongside iron-rich foods can significantly enhance non-heme iron absorption.
                    Avoid Certain Inhibitors: Calcium, polyphenols (found in tea, coffee, and red wine), and phytates (found in some whole grains and legumes) can inhibit iron absorption. Try to consume these at different times from iron-rich meals.
                    Cook in Cast Iron: Cooking acidic foods (like tomatoes) in cast iron cookware can increase the iron content of the food.</p>
